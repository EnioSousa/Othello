                    <ul>
                        <li>Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.</li>
                        <li>Each player gets 32 discs and black always starts the game.</li>
                        <li>Then the game alternates between white and black until:
                            <ul>
                                <li>one player can not make a valid move to outflank the opponent.</li>
                                <li>both players have no valid moves.</li>
                            </ul>
                            When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and the opponent continues.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>A player can not voluntarily forfeit his turn.</li>
                        <li>When both players can not make a valid move the gane ends.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="inst-box-2" class="text-box" style="display: none;">
                    <h1>Valid Moves</h1>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Black always moves first.</li>
                        <li>A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.</li>
                        <li>A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends by discs of the opposite color.</li>
                        <li>All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.</li>
                        <li>Discs may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disc being played.</li>
                        <li>If you can't outflank and flip at least one opposing disc, you must pass your turn. However, if a move is available to you, you can't forfeit your turn.</li>
                        <li>Once a disc has been placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.</li>
                        <li>When a player runs out of discs, but still has opportunities to outflank an opposing disc, then the opponent must give the player a disc to use.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>The discs are now counted and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.</li>
                        <li>A tie is possible.</li>
